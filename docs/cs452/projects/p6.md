# Project 6

![Fun times](./images/p6-meme.jpg)

## Overview

In this project you will implement a FIFO queue as a monitor that can be
used to solve the bounded buffer problem. Your queue will have a fixed
capacity and will block calling threads when it is full or empty.
Bounded buffers are extremely common in Operating Systems. When you
write code in Java, Python, C#, etc. it may seem like you have infinite
memory. However, infinite memory is just an abstraction that the OS
provides, in reality you are limited by the physical hardware the OS is
running on. This data structure could be used to build higher level
abstractions like a [thread pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool).

## Learning Outcomes

- 1.5 Use simple shell scripts and system tools to analyze process behavior
- 3.3 Identify the sources of deadlocks, race conditions, memory stomps and data loss
- 3.4 Apply concurrent programming techniques such as threads, event loops, and
  inter-process communication

## Grading Rubric

Make sure and review the class [grading rubric](grading-rubric.md) so you know how your project will
be graded.

## Task 2 - Prepare your repository

The starter repository is a bare bones template that you will need to update with the starter code
below.

### src/lab.h

<<< @/code/452/p6/lab.h{c}

### app/main.c

<<< @/code/452/p6/main.c

### tests/test-lab.c

<<< @/code/452/p6/test-lab.c

Once you have updated all the starter code lets make your first commit so everything is saved. Open
up a terminal and lets make a commit!

```bash
git add --all
git commit -m "Added in starter code"
```

## Task 3 - Implement the header file

Implement all the functions defined in `lab.h` in `lab.c`.
