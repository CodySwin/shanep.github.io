# Project 7

![This is fine](./images/p7-meme.jpg)

In this project, you are tasked with implementing a simple kernel module that
will allow you to add a new system call in the kernel.

## Learning Objectives

- 2.2 Explore the system call interface
- 2.3 Show an understanding of the difference between user and kernel space

## Grading Rubric

Make sure and review the class [grading rubric](grading-rubric.md) so you know how your project will
be graded.

## Overview

This Project will be assigned in class. We will be using AWS and their EC2
instances to build and test our kernel module. You will need to have a basic
understanding of how to use AWS and how to build and install a kernel module.

AWS released a new hypervisor in called Nitro that allows us to run our own
kernel modules and debug issues pre-boot, this was something that was not
possible just a few years ago so we will be on the cutting edge of technology!
This is a fantastic opportunity to learn how to leverage the cloud to do some
low-level debugging!

## Building the Kernel

Here are the steps to build and install the kernel to make sure everything is
working correctly. These instructions are for Fedora 38+.

1. Install all the required dependencies and build tools as described in the
   minimal build instructions in the [kernel
   README](https://docs.kernel.org/process/changes.html). These tools will be in
   different packages depending on your distribution. For Fedora, you can run
   the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo dnf install -y gcc make flex bison elfutils-libelf-devel openssl-devel bc llvm clang lld openssl openssl-devel
    ```

2. Make a new directory to build clone the kernel source

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/kernel && cd ~/kernel
    ```

3. Clone Linus's tree from [git.kernel.org](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git)

    ```bash
    git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
    ```

4. Generate a default configuration file from your local kernel configuration so
   you can build the kernel and required modules.

    ```bash
    make localmodconfig
    ```
