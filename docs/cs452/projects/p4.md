# Project 4

![P4 Meme](./images/p4-meme.jpeg)

## Overview

You job is to implement a memory manager using the buddy algorithm as
described by Dr. Knuth in The Art of Computer programming Volume 1 -
Fundamental Algorithms. You will use the mmap() system call to get a
large block of memory to manage. From there on, manage the chunk of
memory returned by mmap using your own memory management functions.

## Learning Outcomes

- 2.1 Demonstrate how low level memory is managed in user space
- 2.2 Explore the system call interface
- 3.1 Analyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of computing and
    other relevant disciplines to identify solutions. **(ABET Outcome 1)**

## Grading Rubric

Make sure and review the class [grading rubric](grading-rubric.md) so you know how your project will
be graded.


<!--@include: ../../../parts/project-setup-boiler.md -->


## Task 2 - Prepare your repository

The starter repository is a bare bones template that you will need to update with the starter code
below.

::: info

This project will be 100% unit test. You will not need to use the file `app/main.c` all your work
will be done int `src/lab.c` and `tests/test-lab.c`

:::

### src/lab.h

<<< @/code/452/p4/lab.h{c}

### tests/test-lab.c

<<< @/code/452/p4/test-lab.c

Once you have updated all the starter code lets make your first commit so everything is saved. Open
up a terminal and lets make a commit!

```bash
git add --all
git commit -m "Added in starter code"
```

## Task 3 - Implement Buddy

Implement the [Buddy Algorithm](/articles/Buddy-System.pdf).

::: warning

You are NOT allowed to use **any functions** from the math library! You are
required to use bit shifting and masking for your calculations. So this means no
`pow()` or `log2()` functions should be found in your code.

:::

## Task 4 - Write Unit tests

Follow the instructions in the project README to run the code coverage tool.
Add enough tests beyond what the professor has given you to get as close to 100%
coverage as possible.


## Additional Resources

From the example in Knuth’s book we can calculate the buddy of a block
of size 16. With the table above we know that a block of size 16 is K=4
so we will have 4 zeros at the right. Using the [XOR
operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or) we can calculate
the buddy as follows:

       101110010110000
     ^ 000000000010000
    ------------------
       101110010100000

### Knuth notation to C syntax quick reference

    struct buddy_pool *pool;
    struct avail *L;

| Knuth notation | C syntax               |
|----------------|------------------------|
| AVAILF[k]      | pool-&gt;avail[k].next |
| AVAILB[k]      | pool-&gt;avail[k].prev |
| LOC(AVAIL[k])  | &amp;pool-&gt;avail[k] |
| LINKF(L)       | L-&gt;next             |
| LINKB(L)       | L-&gt;prev             |
| TAG(L)         | L-&gt;tag              |
| KVAL(L)        | L-&gt;kval             |
| buddyk(L)      | buddy_calc(pool, L);   |

### Power of 2 quick reference

As specified in the algorithm in order for everything to work you must
work in powers of two! This includes the address that you get back from
mmap. You will need to scale the address appropriately or you will
calculate invalid buddy values. You can use the table below for a quick
reference for up to K=40.

| Power (k value) | Bytes             | KiB/MiB/GiB/TiB |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 2^0             | 1                 |

### Hints


- There should be no hard coded constants in your code. You will need
    to use the macros defined in the [C99
    standard](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/integer) to get the
    correct width. For example to calculate a K value 64bit system you
    would write `UINT64_C(1) << kval` NOT `1 << kval`
- Remember to take into account the size of your header when
    calculating your K value. If a user asked for 32 bytes you will need
    to use K=6 not K=5 to account for the header size.
- If the memory cannot be allocated, then your buddy\_calloc or
    buddy\_malloc functions should set errno to ENOMEM (which is defined
    in errno.h header file) and return NULL.
- You can’t use malloc/free/realloc/calloc from the C standard library.
- You will need to make extensive use of pointer arithmetic! When you
    are dealing with raw (untyped) memory make sure and cast the pointer
    to the correct type so it is moved the correct amount.
- Be mindful of the differences between `sizeof(struct foo)` and
    `sizeof(struct foo*)`. The first instance give you the size of the
    struct while the second gives you the size of a pointer. If the size
    of the struct just **happens** to be the same as a pointer your code
    will appear to work until you either add a new member to `foo` OR
    you move to a system where the sizes of pointers are different. For
    example moving from a 64bit system to a 32 bit system or vice versa!

## Debugging Raw memory

In the C programming language we can allocate a chunk of memory on the
heap and treat that chunk of memory as an array. If you are working on
debugging a problem and want to inspect the contents of the array using
the GUI debugger interface in VSCode you may have to tell the debugger
(with a cast) that a pointer is actually pointing to a dynamically
allocated array not a single variable. This example walks through how to
display a pointer as an array that is embedded within a struct.

More reading about C and GDB.

- [Reading C Declarations](http://unixwiz.net/techtips/reading-cdecl.html)
- [GDB Artificial Arrays](https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/Arrays.html)
- [GDB to LLDB usage](http://lldb.llvm.org/use/map.html)
- [VSCode Data inspection](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_data-inspection)

Consider the struct declaration `buddy_pool` shown below. The `avail`
member is a pointer that we must dynamically allocate and want to
display in the debugger as an array. We can allocate the a `buddy_pool`
struct (in the stack or data segment) and then dynamically allocate the
`avail` array using `malloc`.

```c
struct avail
{
    int tag;
    int kval;
    struct avail *next;
    struct avail *prev;
}
struct buddy_pool
{
    size_t kval_m;
    uintptr_t base;
    struct avail *avail; /*pointer to the start of the avail array*/
};
struct buddy_pool pool;
pool.kval = 9;
pool.base = 0;
pool.avail = malloc(sizeof(struct avail) * 9);
```

If we run the debugger we will see the variable `pool` with the element
`avail` is displayed as a single variable not an array of 9 structs as
we expected.

![Pointer not showing the full array](images/pointer_as_array_bad.png)

The element `avail` is just a pointer to the memory address of element
and the debugger can’t determine the size of the array and thus will
display it as a single struct instead of an array as expected.

Fortunately, all is not lost! Most debuggers allow you to set a watch on
a memory location and you can force the debugger to cast the memory to a
certain type. Both gdb and lldb have specific commands to display a
memory block as an array. However, using casting works regardless of
what debugger you are using.

If we add a new
[watch](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_data-inspection)
on a variable and then force the debugger to display the memory block as
an array instead of a single variable we can easily inspect the data and
track down any issues you are experiencing.

`(struct avail(*) [9])pool->avail`

![Watch var showing the full array](images/setting_watch_vscode.gif)

For a plain old dynamic array you can add a watch expression that is set
to to the desired type.

`*(int(*)[10])A`
