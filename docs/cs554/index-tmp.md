### Week 2: Literature Review

What to research is a hard question. For most of your academic career, you have
been given a problem to solve, you solve it, get a grade, and move on. In this
class, you will need to come up with your own problem to solve. This is a hard!

Last week you found 2 research papers that you found interesting. This week you
will present them to the class. This will help you to see where the state of the
art is and what problems are still open. Don't worry if you didn't find anything
we will work on this together.

### Week 4: RQ's

### Mon 09/09

- Defining your Research Project (in class)
  - Key words
  - Research Questions
  - Approach
- Overleaf and LaTeX
  - [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
  - [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)

#### Wed 09/11

- Artifacts and Reproducibility - [ACM Artifact Review and
  Badging](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current)
- Create your research proposal skelton

::: tip Week 4 - Deliverable

You will need to create your project proposal (preferably in overleaf) and share
it with your instructor by the end of the week. You will need to have 3 RQ's
defined, don't worry if they are not perfect, we will work on them together and
you can change them later.

### Week 5: Proposals

- Project proposal report
  - Your project proposal should be at least 2 pages (IEEE Conference
    Proceedings Format), and it should include:
  - Introduction: Describe the problem, why the problem is important, your
    proposed solution, and how you expect your solution to improve the state of
    the art.
  - Related work: Describe other published research related to the project that
    you are proposing. Other research can be related because it motivates the
    need for your project, it tries to solve the same problem in a different
    way, it uses your proposed technique for other problems, etc.

::: tip Week 5 - Deliverable

You will need to have your project proposal completed by Wednesday. You will
present it to the class and turn in a hard copy at the end of your presentation.

:::

### Week 6 - 8: Work on Research Paper

- We will be working on our research papers for the next 3 weeks. You will need
  to have a draft of your paper completed by the end of week 8. This will be a
  rough draft and will need to be refined over the next 8 weeks.
- We will be discussing the following sections of your paper:
  - Introduction
  - Related Work
  - Approach
  - Implementation
  - Evaluation
  - Conclusion

::: tip Week 6-8 - Deliverable

Each student will need to turn in a hard copy of the research paper with their
annotations at the end of each week presentation. This is your participation grade.

### Week 9

- Mid-semester project presentation
  - Your project progress presentation should include:
  - Problem description (updated from your project proposal)
  - Research Questions
  - Solution description (updated and extended from your project proposal)
  - Progress made so far (since your project proposal)
  - Planning for the remaining weeks
  - Potential roadblocks that you may encounter in the remaining weeks and how
    you expect to overcome them

### Week 16

- Your final project report should be a minimum of 10 pages (including
  references) and a maximum of 10 pages (plus references). The report should
  include:
  - Introduction: Describe the problem, why the problem is important, your
    proposed solution, and how you expect your solution to improve the state of
    the art.
  - Related work: Describe other published research related to the project that
    you are proposing. Other research can be related because: it motivates the
    need for your project, it tries to solve the same problem in a different
    way, it uses your proposed technique for other problems, etc.
  - Approach: conceptual description of your solution
  - Implementation: technical description of the solution that you implemented
  - Evaluation: description of the experiments that you performed and
    interpretation of your results.
  - Conclusion: Did you solve the problem? To what extent? For which cases?
  - References: Citations of all the research papers relevant to your project

::: tip Week 16 - Deliverable

Turn in a final hard copy of your paper in class and present your project to the
