# RStudio Tips and Tricks

This document will walk you through doing development using RStudio and
introduce you to some cool tips and tricks. You can install RStudio on
your personal machine, or you can use RStudio in the [cloud](https://posit.co/products/cloud/cloud/).

While the cloud version of RStudio is free, it does require an internet
connection to do your work. The advantage of using the cloud version is that you
don't have to install and configure all the tools on your local machine. The
disadvantage is that you need an internet connection to do your work and you
can't customize the environment as much as you can on your local machine. So if
you are going to be traveling to a conference or a workshop and you have a 14
hour flight to get there, you might want to install RStudio on your local
machine.

The rest of this document assumes you are using RStudio on your local machine.
